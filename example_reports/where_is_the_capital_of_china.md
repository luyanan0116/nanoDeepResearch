## Survey Note

A deeper academic analysis shows that:

- Despite its robust economic and political stature, the city faces challenges: lagging tourism recovery post-pandemic, difficulty attracting and retaining foreign talent, and balancing affordability with livability.
- Beijing’s economic might comes second only to Shanghai but is distinguished by its concentration of governmental and cultural institutions.
- Comparative frameworks consistently rank Beijing among China’s top four lead cities for regional and national influence across multiple domains.
